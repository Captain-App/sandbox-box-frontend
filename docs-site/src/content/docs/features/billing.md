Shipbox operates on a credits-first metering system. No surprises, no runaway costs.

### Credit Balance

Your balance is shown in GBP. Credits are consumed based on:

- **Compute Time**: Active time for your sandboxes (typically 1 credit per minute).
- **AI Usage**: Token-based pricing if you are not using a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) setup.
- **Capability Purchases**: Premium tools or modules.

### Consumption Tracking

The dashboard shows your **Monthly Consumption**, which is the total value of credits spent across all activities in the current 30-day period.

### Topping Up

Click **Top Up** to add credits to your account via Stripe. We recommend enabling auto-recharge if your agent performs long-running autonomous tasks.

### Transaction History

Track all credit deductions and top-ups in real-time in the **Recent Transactions** table. Each entry shows the amount, date, and description (e.g., "Sandbox usage for session-abc").
